      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that's as comforting as it is delicious. At its core, lasagna is made of layers of wide, flat pasta sheets alternated with various fillings and sauces.</p>

        <li>Golden onions 50g</li>
        <li>Tomato passata 200ml</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil, as needed</li>
        <li>Black pepper, as needed</li>
        <li>Celery 50g</li>
        <li>Milk 100ml</li>
        <li>Red wine 100ml</li>
        <li>Diced Pancetta - 75g</li>
        <li>Fine salt, as needed</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps: </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Let's start the preparation of Bolognese ragù by sautéing the pancetta on its own. Keep it on high heat until some fat has melted.</li>
        <li>Add olive oil, chopped celery, carrot, and onion, and mix with a spoon. Cook the soffritto for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Crumble the ground meat slightly as you pour it into the pot, and stir to distribute it evenly. After 5 minutes, deglaze with wine and continue cooking for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now add the tomato passata and adjust the salt and pepper, giving it a good stir.</li>
        <li>Cook over very low heat for at least an hour and a half with the lid on to thicken our ragù.</li>
        <li>Add the milk to the pot and finish cooking for another 5 minutes. The consistency should be homogeneous and creamy; if needed, let it cook for up to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the ragù is ready, we can assemble the lasagna: spread a few spoonfuls of ragù on the bottom of a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place a lasagna sheet on top and cover with more ragù.</li>
        <li>Drizzle some béchamel sauce over the ragù.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with a handful of grated cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover with another sheet and repeat: ragù, béchamel, grated cheese. In the final layer, we can be generous with both béchamel and cheese, for a super appetizing gratin!</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated oven at 180°C for 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, let them settle for a few minutes, and then serve our piping hot Bolognese lasagna!</li>
        <li>Bolognese lasagna will be even better if we use homemade fresh pasta, but this preparation requires a pasta machine. Don't have one at home? No problem, let's use ready-made fresh pasta from the refrigerator section. The same goes for the béchamel for Bolognese lasagna: if we use homemade béchamel, the dish will certainly benefit from it. We assembled the lasagna keeping the ragù and béchamel separate and adding these two ingredients in succession. Some people mix them from the start and pour the resulting mixture directly onto the pasta sheet. This way, the pasta will have a more uniform color and will be equally delicious.</li>
