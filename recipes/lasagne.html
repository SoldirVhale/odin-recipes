      <h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Let's start the preparation of Bolognese ragù by sautéing the pancetta on its own. Keep it on high heat until some fat has melted.</li>
        <li>Add olive oil, chopped celery, carrot, and onion, and mix with a spoon. Cook the soffritto for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Crumble the ground meat slightly as you pour it into the pot, and stir to distribute it evenly. After 5 minutes, deglaze with wine and continue cooking for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now add the tomato passata and adjust the salt and pepper, giving it a good stir.</li>
        <li>Cook over very low heat for at least an hour and a half with the lid on to thicken our ragù.</li>
        <li>Add the milk to the pot and finish cooking for another 5 minutes. The consistency should be homogeneous and creamy; if needed, let it cook for up to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the ragù is ready, we can assemble the lasagna: spread a few spoonfuls of ragù on the bottom of a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place a lasagna sheet on top and cover with more ragù.</li>
        <li>Drizzle some béchamel sauce over the ragù.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with a handful of grated cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover with another sheet and repeat: ragù, béchamel, grated cheese. In the final layer, we can be generous with both béchamel and cheese, for a super appetizing gratin!</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated oven at 180°C for 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, let them settle for a few minutes, and then serve our piping hot Bolognese lasagna!</li>
