      <p class="servings">Servings: <i class="fa-solid fa-person"></i> <i class="fa-solid fa-person"></i></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flour - 250g</li>
        <li>Instant Pizza Yeast - 1/2 a packet</li>
        <li>Sugar - 1 Teaspoon</li>
        <li>Water - 20ml</li>
        <li>Olive oil - 1,5 Tablespoons</li>
        <li>Water - 175ml</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce - 125g</li>
        <li>Mozzarella - 150g</li>
        <li>Dried Oregano, to taste</li>
        <li>Basil, to taste</li>
        <li>Olive Oil, to taste</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Place the flour in a bowl, add the instant pizza yeast and two teaspoons of sugar, and mix.</li>
        <li>Add a teaspoon of salt, olive oil, and water, a little at a time.</li>
        <li>Knead with a spoon and then by hand until you obtain a smooth dough.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for 15 minutes. This step is not mandatory, but we recommend it because resting will make it easier to roll out the pizzas.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough onto a floured surface and divide it into 4 portions. Cover one of the dough balls with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out.</li>
        <li>Flatten the dough ball with your hands and shape it into a disk the size of the skillet you will be using (we recommend using one around 26-28 cm in diameter).</li>
        <li>Take it with your hands and transfer it to the hot skillet with a drizzle of oil. Cook covered over medium heat for 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip the pizza with a spatula, put the lid back on, and cook for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now flip it again and top the pizza with tomato sauce and cubed pizza mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Put the lid back on and cook for another 2-3 minutes, then turn off the heat and, if needed, leave the lid on for a few more minutes to melt the mozzarella. Proceed like this for all the pizzas. If we want to speed up the preparation, we can cook the pizzas in the skillet and then finish them under the oven broiler or in an air fryer after adding the toppings.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, if desired, drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with some oregano and fresh basil. Pan Pizza is ready to be served and enjoyed with company!</li>
