      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Polenta taragna is a traditional Northern Italian dish made by mixing coarsely ground cornmeal with buckwheat flour. It's cooked slowly to create a creamy texture with a slightly nutty flavor. Often served as a side dish or topped with sautéed mushrooms or cheese, it's a hearty and versatile dish that's perfect for showcasing the flavors of Northern Italian cuisine.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Buckwheat flour - 150g</li>
        <li>Yellow cornmeal - 90g</li>
        <li>Water - 1 lt</li>
        <li>Butter - 60g</li>
        <li>Branzi or Casera cheese - 200g</li>
        <li>Coarse Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Sage, to taste</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine the flours in a bowl and mix them with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Place a pot of water on the stove, add salt, and gradually sprinkle in the flour mixture while stirring with a whisk.</li>
        <li>Cook for about 35 minutes over medium heat, stirring frequently until thickened.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt the butter in a pan and add the sage.</li>
        <li>Peel off the rind and dice the cheese with a cutting board and knife.</li>
        <li>When the polenta is nearing the end of its cooking time and has a dense but soft consistency, pour in the butter and sage mixture.</li>
        <li>Add the cheese and stir over low heat for a few minutes to combine everything, then serve the piping hot polenta taragna after portioning it into bowls.</li>
        <li>For cheese in polenta taragna, Monte cheese, Casera, and Formai de Mut work well. The important thing is to cut them into cubes and melt them in the polenta over the heat.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If we want to make it an even richer main course, we can create many recipes with polenta taragna. We can adapt the recipe to our tastes and menus. We can enrich it with a delicious meat stew, prepared with our favorite recipe. Alternatively, we can make polenta taragna with sausage: brown it separately and then place it on the polenta. For a vegetarian version, instead, we can skip the meats and cold cuts and use mushrooms, perhaps sautéed.</p>
